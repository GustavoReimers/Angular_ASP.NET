# West Wind Album Viewer ASP.NET 5 Sample
**Sample Angular 2.0 application demonstrating ASP.NET Core features**

This is a sample ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates basic features of ASP.NET Core in an API backend application with an Angular 2.0 front end. The application allows browsing and editing of a list of albums and artists interactively.

**Online Sample:**
* [Live AlbumViewer Sample](https://samples.west-wind.com/AlbumViewerCore/)

### ASP.NET Core Features
The **ASP.NET Core** Backend demonstrates:

* Creating an API backend service
* Isolating business logic and Controller code
* Using a base Repository for business logic
* Separating code into separate projects
* Custom User Authentication
* CORS Support
* Using ASP.NET Core as a backend to an Angular 2.0 front end

The sample also includes a few Server Side Rendered MVC pages for browsing and viewing of albums and artists. I'll be adding the edit pages at a later point.

Version supported:  
**ASP.NET Core 1.01**

### Angular 2.0 Features
The **Angular 2.0** Frontend application demonstrates:

* Mobile friendly, adaptive UI
* Routing
* Animations and Page Transitions
* Client side and server side Authentication tracking
* Managing Server Urls (dev/production)

The front end has been rebuilt from an Angular 1.5 application, so it's not quite broken down into small components yet - a future refactor will address that.

Version supported:  
**Angular 2.0 RTM**


### Getting Started ###
You should just be able to clone this repo as is on either Windows or Mac (and probably Linux) and do:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

in the `./src/albumviewercore` folder.

Then navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to start the application. First launch might fail due a timeout due to the initial DB creation, but subsequent requests should work.

If you're running the application locally through IIS or Kestrel, the application should just work as is. By default it uses a SqLite data base that is created in the Web app's content (not Web) root. 

The sample also works with SQL Server but you have to create the database for that to work and set the connection string in `appsettings.json`. 


To switch between SqLite and Sql Server use the `useSqlLite` configuration settings:

```json
  "Data": {
    "AlbumViewer": {
      "useSqLite": "true",
      "SqlServerConnectionString": "server=.;database=AlbumViewer;integrated security=true;",
    } 
  },
  //... other settings omitted
}
```  

In either case initial albums/artist data should auto-create the first time the app is run.

##### Using SqLite
SqLite will automatically create the database file in the content content root of the project (same folder as project.json). For this to work make sure that the account the Web application is running under has appropriate rights to create a new file and read/write to that file in the content folder.

##### Using Sql Server
To use Sql Server create a new empty database and then point the connection string at the new database. Make sure the account the Web server is running under has rights to create tables and then read/write data.

#### To develop the AlbumViewer Angular 2 example
The front end in the repo comes with pre-compiled .js files for the sample, so the application will just run through IIS Express/IIS or Kestrel.

Making changes to the Angular 2.0 application requires transpiling of the typescript source files. In order to make changes to the Angular 2 client sample run the following from a command window:

```
cd <installFolder>\src\AlbumViewerNetCore
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

then navigate to **http://localhost:3000** to run the application. Note this uses the WebPack development server rather than through IIS Express or Kestrel.

Depending on which port you run the ASP.NET Core application you may have to change the API server base URL which defaults to **http://localhost:5000/** in the `app/business/appConfiguration.ts` file.

Once you've made your changes, you need to build the application's final output. Run:

```
npm run build:prod
```

or

```
webpack -p
```

which creates the final transpiled bundles you can use to run your application through the ASP.NET Core application.

#### Platforms 
Currently the app has been tested to run under Windows and Mac, but it should also work under Linux.
