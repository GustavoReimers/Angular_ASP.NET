    </h3>

    <hr />
    <p>
        This sample application demonstrates using a client centric JavaScript
        framework to communicate with a Web Connection backend via JSON. This is
        a common usage pattern today that uses the Web Browser as a rich client
        to provide an interactive user interface connected to data served from
        a Web Server. This example uses <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJs</a>,
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> css and the web
        connection <a href="http://west-wind.com/webconnection/docs?page=_45p0t1xls.htm">wwRestProcess class</a>
        to provide this client centric and mobile aware, Web based sample.

             style="margin-left: 10px;"
             class="pull-right" alt="QR Tag for current URL open in your web browser"

        <h4>Mobile</h4>

        <p>
            The sample is built using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> using mobile-first design mode. What this
            means is that the site is adaptive and works well on mobile devices as well as on large screens. You
            should be able to access this sample with just about any reasonably recent
            smartphone browser and get a decent usability experience. If you want to
            access the site with a mobile phone you can use the QR code on the right
            to scan and launch the site on your phone.

        <h4>wwRestProcess Web Connection JSON Service</h4>
        <p>
            This sample application demonstrates using the wwRestProcess class on the
            Web Connection back end, which provides the 'data service' to provide the
            data for this sample. The backend simply returns JSON data in request to
            XHR HTTP requests from the client JavaScript application. Each data
            request is simply a method in the wwRESTProcess subclass that receives
            a single input parameter for JSON post data (or any form or querystring values)
            and returns a simple value, object, collection/array or cursor as a result.

        <h4>AngularJs Front End</h4>
        <p>
            The client application is a pure JavaScript based front end launched from
            a plain .html page (no server code in the HTML). The front end uses <a href="angularjs.org">AngularJs</a>
            UI presentation, data-binding and accessing of the remote HTTP service to
            pull down the application data. AngularJs's strongly opinionated framework
            and especially the databinding and modularization of client side JavaScript code
            make it easy to create rich front ends to backend data as demonstrated by this small
            sample application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that this application purposefully mixes a few different approaches in
            some of the modules to demonstrate different ways that you can do things. The
            albums views use the albumsService to explicitly isolate 'data' specific service
            operations and 'business logic'. The Artist views opt for the simpler direct
            access to data from controllers, which - while considered bad practice for
            testing and reusability - does make for a lot less code and easier to follow
            self-contained logic. The latter approach is valid for isolated or simple
            components/pieces in applications.
